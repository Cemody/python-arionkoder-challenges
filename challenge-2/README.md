# Challenge 2: Resource Management Context Manager

## Overview

Challenge 2 implements a robust context manager for managing connections to multiple external resources with comprehensive error handling, detailed logging, and performance metrics tracking.

## Key Features

### âœ… Core Requirements Met
- **Custom Context Manager**: Async context manager using `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` methods
- **Multiple Resource Support**: Database (SQLite), API (aiohttp), and Cache (in-memory LRU)
- **Proper Exception Cleanup**: Guaranteed cleanup even when exceptions occur
- **Parallel Operations**: Connections established and cleaned up in parallel for performance

### ðŸš€ Enhanced Features
- **Detailed Logging**: Structured logging with file and console output
- **Performance Metrics**: Comprehensive timing and success/failure tracking
- **Analytics**: Performance analytics with error tracking and success rates
- **FastAPI Integration**: REST API endpoints for testing and monitoring
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test suite with 10+ test functions

â”œâ”€â”€ resource_manager.db      # SQLite database with performance tracking
â””â”€â”€ resource_manager.log     # Detailed operation logs
```

## Core Components

### 1. ResourceManager Context Manager
```python
async with ResourceManager(['database', 'api', 'cache']) as resources:
    # All resources are connected and ready to use
    db_result = await resources['database'].execute_operation(...)
    cache_result = await resources['cache'].execute_operation(...)
    # Automatic cleanup happens here, even if exceptions occur
```

### 2. Connection Classes
- **DatabaseConnection**: SQLite operations with performance tracking
- **APIConnection**: HTTP requests with aiohttp and retry logic
- **CacheConnection**: In-memory LRU cache with statistics

### 3. Performance Tracking
- **PerformanceMetrics**: Dataclass for tracking timing and success rates
- **Database Analytics**: Stored metrics for long-term analysis
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live performance data via API endpoints

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/resources/test` | POST | Test specific resource connections |
| `/resources/status` | GET | Get current status of all resources |
| `/resources/execute` | POST | Execute operations on resources |
| `/resources/analytics` | GET | Get performance analytics and metrics |

## Exception Handling

The context manager ensures proper cleanup in all scenarios:

1. **Normal Operation**: All connections cleaned up automatically
2. **Resource Failure**: Failed connections don't prevent cleanup of successful ones
3. **Operation Exceptions**: Context manager cleanup happens even during exceptions
4. **Parallel Cleanup**: Multiple resources disconnected simultaneously for efficiency

## Performance Features

### Logging
- **Structured Logging**: JSON-like format with timestamps and context
- **Multiple Handlers**: Console and file logging with different levels
- **Operation Tracking**: Detailed logs for each resource operation

### Metrics
- **Timing Measurements**: Microsecond precision for all operations
- **Success/Failure Tracking**: Comprehensive error counting and categorization
- **Memory Usage**: Resource usage monitoring where applicable
- **Analytics Functions**: Aggregated performance data and trends

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- âœ… Context manager functionality
- âœ… Individual resource connections
- âœ… Exception handling and cleanup
- âœ… Performance metrics tracking
- âœ… API endpoint functionality
- âœ… Database operations and queries
- âœ… Cache operations and LRU behavior
- âœ… Error recovery and logging

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/test_resource_manager.py -v

# Run specific test
python -m pytest tests/test_resource_manager.py::test_resource_manager_context -v

# Run FastAPI tests
uvicorn app:app &
python test_api.py
```

## Demo Usage

```bash
# Comprehensive demonstration
python demo.py

# Start FastAPI server
uvicorn app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000

# Test API endpoints
python test_api.py
```

## Key Achievements

1. **Robust Exception Handling**: Proper cleanup guaranteed in all failure scenarios
2. **Performance Optimization**: Parallel connection setup/teardown
3. **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed operation tracking and debugging
4. **Production Ready**: Full error handling, logging, and monitoring
5. **Scalable Design**: Easy to add new resource types
6. **Real-time Monitoring**: Live performance metrics and analytics

## Implementation Highlights

- **Async Context Manager**: Proper implementation with `__aenter__` and `__aexit__`
- **Parallel Operations**: Using `asyncio.gather()` for concurrent connection management
- **Error Isolation**: Individual resource failures don't cascade
- **Structured Logging**: Professional logging with proper formatting
- **Performance Tracking**: Comprehensive metrics collection and analysis
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with dedicated classes for each resource type

This implementation demonstrates advanced Python async programming, proper resource management, and production-ready error handling and monitoring.
